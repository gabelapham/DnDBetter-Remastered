# DnDBetter Remastered
This is a re-imagination of my CS340 project from Fall '23. I had previously worked with teammates to make the website/webapp possible, but I've now taken it upon myself to
create an application for personal Dungeons & Dragon use.

The goal of DnDBetter Remastered is to provide myself with a fun, personal project to work on alongside my higher education. The webapp itself will serve as an editable character sheet used for the 5th edition of Dungeons & Dragons, a tabletop roleplaying game
created by the Wizards of the Coast.
